# Paisabazaar-Banking-Fraud

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing fraudulent activities within Paisabazaarâ€™s banking transaction dataset. The goal is to uncover fraud patterns using data analysis techniques and offer insights that can help in fraud detection and prevention.

##  Objective

To detect potential banking fraud by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and identifying suspicious patterns using a dataset containing customer transaction information.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Key Analysis Performed

- Data quality checks and null value handling
- Class imbalance detection and visualization
- Feature-wise analysis of fraud vs non-fraud transactions
- Correlation heatmaps
- Boxplots, histograms, and countplots for EDA
- Fraud pattern observation through categorical variables

## Insights

- A very small percentage of transactions are fraudulent, confirming a class imbalance issue.
- Certain transaction types or channels showed higher tendencies of fraud.
- Fraudulent transactions often had anomalies in amount, account age, or activity frequency.
- High correlation among some numeric fields suggests redundancy or predictive potential.

## Business Impact

The findings can help the Paisabazaar team:
- Improve fraud detection algorithms
- Set up rule-based alert systems
- Understand behavioral fraud patterns for risk profiling
