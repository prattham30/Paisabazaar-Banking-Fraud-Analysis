To support this objective, analyzing customer data and categorizing credit scores based on financial behavior—such as income, credit usage, and payment history—can offer crucial insights that improve risk management and overall business strategy.\n","\n","The dataset under study includes several important variables like annual income, number of bank accounts, credit utilization ratio, outstanding debt, delayed payments, and credit history. These features serve as the foundation for developing a predictive model capable of classifying users into one of three categories: “Good,” “Standard,” or “Poor” credit score. This model aims to assist Paisabazaar in accurately determining the creditworthiness of applicants and tailoring financial offerings accordingly.\n","\n","Univariate Analysis\n","This initial step allowed us to explore each variable independently. For example, studying the distribution of age revealed the most common customer age groups. A pie chart visualizing credit score segments showcased how the customer base is distributed in terms of credit risk. Boxplots of variables like annual income highlighted both income variation and the presence of extreme values, which are critical when designing custom loan products for high-income or outlier profiles.\n","\n","Bivariate Analysis\n","Next, we examined how two variables relate to each other. A scatter plot of annual income versus outstanding debt showed that while high-income individuals may carry more debt, this doesn’t always indicate a poor credit profile. A boxplot comparing credit utilization ratios across credit score categories illustrated that higher utilization generally correlates with lower credit ratings, reinforcing its importance as a risk metric. Additionally, a line chart analyzing the relationship between monthly in-hand salary and the number of delayed payments suggested that customers with lower salaries are more prone to payment delays—an indicator of financial pressure.\n","\n","Multivariate Analysis\n","To gain deeper insights, we explored how multiple factors interact simultaneously. A correlation heatmap of numerical variables like income, debt, and credit inquiries helped us detect strong relationships that may affect credit risk. Moreover, a pairplot involving age, income, and credit scores offered a multi-dimensional perspective on customer segments, highlighting how different features cluster together for various credit risk groups."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://github.com/prattham30/Paisabazaar-Banking-Fraud\n"],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Paisabazaar, a prominent financial services platform, plays a key role in helping users compare and apply for credit and banking products. A fundamental aspect of this service involves evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants — a factor that significantly influences loan approval rates and risk control measures. While traditional credit scoring methods are widely used, they often fail to capture the full range of financial behaviors and personal characteristics, which can lead to inaccurate risk assessments and suboptimal lending decisions.\n","\n","To overcome these limitations, Paisabazaar aims to implement a data-driven credit scoring solution that leverages detailed customer demographic and financial information.

Develop a Credit Scoring Prediction System\n","Leverage key financial indicators such as annual income, existing debts, credit utilization rates, repayment patterns, and past delays in payments to build a machine learning-based credit scoring model. Algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Logistic Regression can be employed to classify users into categories like “Good,” “Average,” and “Poor” credit profiles.\n","This automated system will streamline the evaluation process, ensuring quicker decisions and minimizing risk by flagging potentially default-prone borrowers early.\n","\n","2. Offer Tailored Financial Product Suggestions\n","By segmenting users based on their credit profiles and financial behavior (e.g., number of loans taken, credit inquiries made, and payment discipline), Paisabazaar can provide more personalized loan products.\n","For instance, customers with strong credit scores could be targeted with premium offerings and lower interest rates, while those with weaker profiles may receive smaller, more manageable loans or be guided toward financial advisory services.\n","Additionally, using insights such as common income brackets or job types among applicants can further refine marketing and product recommendations.\n","\n","3. Strengthen Risk Management Framework\n","Implement risk-based pricing strategies where applicants with higher credit risk (e.g., high utilization or missed payments) face slightly adjusted interest rates. At the same time, offer structured payment plans or tools to help these customers stay on track.\n","Such measures help balance business growth with risk mitigation, protecting revenue while extending services to a broader user base.\n","\n","4. Promote Credit Awareness and Support\n","Introduce educational initiatives for users who display poor credit habits, such as only paying minimum dues or maxing out credit limits. Providing timely credit counseling and practical advice on improving financial health can boost both repayment rates and customer trust.\n","Empowering users to manage their credit responsibly benefits both the customer and the platform in the long run."],"metadata":{"id":"pASKb0qOza21"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Conclusion**"],"metadata":{"id":"gCX9965dhzqZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["By harnessing the power of data analytics and implementing a predictive credit scoring system, Paisabazaar can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of its credit evaluation process.
